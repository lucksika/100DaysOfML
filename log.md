# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

**Day 0: July 16, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** I checked out on "Preventing the Spread of Dengue Fever" project idea. I also setup the environment for this project.

**Thoughts:** This project looks quite challenging. This is my really first project which I start it from the beginning. 

**Day 1: July 17, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Try to vitualize the data. Finding some relationship or pattern.

**Thoughts:** Not sure about the relationship between features.

**Day 2: August 28, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** I change my project to the face recognition thing. Find the code online from github and try to use it with my image but the accuracy is lower than I though.

**Thoughts:** My knowledge about face recognition is nealy zero, but I still want to challenge myself. Try to build it !!!.

**Day 3: October 3, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Setting up the Google Colab for this project. Change the code, using the code for face recognition from other github repository. The program still cannot recognize the faces. Try to find the reason why the program cannot saperate and recognize asian girls from the korean girl group.

**Thoughts:** They are too similar to each other even my friends cannot recognize them. Long way to go !

**Day 4: October 4, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Try to find the reason why the program cannot saperate and recognize asian girls from the korean girl group.

**Thoughts:** They are too similar to each other even my friends cannot recognize them. Long way to go !

**Day 5: October 5, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Try to find the reason why the program cannot saperate and recognize asian girls from the korean girl group. Using 3 models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) for trainning and predicting the results. The result is more acceptable.

**Thoughts:** The dataset for training model is really important !!!

**Day 6: October 16, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Try implement the face recognition model with the video

**Thoughts:** The quality of the test video is effect the result.

**Day 7: October 17, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** Refactoring code and debug the accents problems in linux

**Thoughts:** It's a minor problem but took so much time

**Day 8: October 18, 2018**

**Today's Progress:** After recognize the face, I try to track that face in the video

**Thoughts:** I use dlib tracker to track. The result is quite acceptable in such a limited environment. Improving the performance of face recognition is really hard. In my opinion, it has a lot of factors involved such as the light, the angle of the face, the quality of the image, the number of the train image, etc. So I decided to move on to other project but I still don't have an interesting idea right now.
